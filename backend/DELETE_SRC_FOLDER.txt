⚠️ IMPORTANT: DELETE THE OLD src/ FOLDER

The backend/src/ folder is NO LONGER NEEDED.

All code has been moved to microservices:
  backend/src/modules/product/  →  backend/product-service/
  backend/src/modules/cart/     →  backend/cart-service/
  backend/src/modules/order/    →  backend/order-service/
  backend/src/modules/auth/     →  backend/auth-service/

TO DELETE:
1. Close all terminals/editors accessing backend/src/
2. Navigate to: c:\ecommerce-app\backend\
3. Right-click "src" folder → Delete
4. Or run as Administrator: rmdir /s /q src

The src/ folder is completely redundant and should be removed.

See CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md for details.
